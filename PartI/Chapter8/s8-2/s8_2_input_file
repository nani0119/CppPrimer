King Athamus of northern Greece had two children， Phrixus and Helle．
After he left his first wife and mar ried Ino，
a wicked woman，the two children received all the cruel treatment that a 
stepmother coulddevise ，At one timethe 
kingdom was ruined by a famine．Ino persuaded her credulous husband 
intobelievingthat his son，Phrixus，was the 
actual cause of the disaster，and should be sacrificed to Zeus to endit．The 
poor boy was then placed on the altar 
and was about tobe knifed when a ram with goldenfleecewas sent down by thegods 
and carried off the two children on its back．As they flew over the strait 
that divides Asia from Europe，Helle，faint at the vast expanse of waterbelow,
fell into the sea and was drowned．Thus the sea of Helle，Hellespont，became 
the ancient name of the strip of water．Her brother kept on and arrived in 
Colchis on the eastern shore of the Black Sea．There he sacrificed the ram 
to Zeus and gave its golden fleece to King Aeetes，who nailed it on a sacred 
tree and put a sleepless dragon incharge ．
